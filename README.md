# ghostcopy
A program that tries to automatically copy files from removable drives to the local drive. It also (very naively) tries to hide itself in the host system and auto-start on boot.

I wrote this back in 2012 in an attempt to be a 1337 h4x0r. It sort of worked back then. I don't know how well it works today, but it was a fun little project at the time.
